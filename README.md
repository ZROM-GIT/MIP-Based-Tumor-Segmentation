## 1. Introduction

This repository accompanies our paper accepted at **EMA4MICCAI 2025**, proposing a method for **tumor segmentation using Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs)** derived from PET/CT scans.

Traditional clinical workflows often start with rotational MIPs for tumor detection before volumetric slice analysis, but automated segmentation models typically operate on 3D volumes, making them computationally intensive.

Our approach:

- Trains segmentation models **directly on MIPs**, matching clinical practice.  
- Introduces a **novel occlusion correction** method for improved MIP annotation quality.  
- Achieves **comparable segmentation accuracy** to 3D models, with significant reductions in training time and computational resources.

## 3. Data Preparation and MIP Generation

### 3.1 Pre-processing

Use the official **autoPET pre-processing tools** (available on the dataset site) to prepare raw 3D PET/CT volumes in niftii format. This ensures standardized, resampled high-quality inputs.

### 3.2 MIP Generation

Our repository provides scripts to generate rotational Multi-Angle MIPs:

- Located in `scripts/mip_generation/`  
- Supports customizable rotation angles and occlusion correction.

**Example command:**

```bash
python scripts/mip_generation/create_mips.py --input_dir path/to/preprocessed_data --output_dir path/to/mip_output --angles 48
```


Soon to be uploaded...
